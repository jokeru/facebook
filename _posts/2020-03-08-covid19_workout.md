## Mens sana in corpore sano

> _How will people remember COVID-19 years from now ?_  
> _For me it'll be the time I PB'd ~once~ twice my running VO2 Max (and much more) !_

My lockdown started Sunday o8 Mar 2o2o by having a case in the company.  
But this was a good thing, more time to train :D

Before that, I was running 2-3 times a week, in preparation for my [2o2o Half IM](/2020/half_im.html) - which was never to happen. But the [knee pains](/2019/03_57_22.html) were starting to creep up on the longer runs so I've decided to get professional help this time. Having met a Pro Dog that year, that call was easy. He gave me a knee rehab program which looked more serious than a normal workout. But I've stopped questioning and started working.
