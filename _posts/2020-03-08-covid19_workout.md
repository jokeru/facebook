## Mens sana in corpore sano

> thanks **[Gordon](https://twitter.com/grett85){:target="_blank"}** for feeding my body

My lockdown started Sunday o8 Mar 2o2o by having a case in the company.  
But this was a good thing, more time to train :D

Before that I've been running 2-3 times a week, in preparation for my [2o2o Half IM](/2020/half_im.html) - which was never to happen. But the [knee pains](/2019/03_57_22.html) were starting to creep up on the longer runs so I've decided to get professional help this time. Having met a Pro Dog around me, that call was easy. He gave me a knee rehab program which looked more serious than a normal workout. But I've stopped questioning and started working.
