## Alright stop, collaborate and listen
## Ice is back with my brand new invention

Having had my fair share of breathwork / Wim Hof and cold showers, the time has come to step up and dip my toes [into the ice](https://www.timvandervliet.com/event/londonputney/){:target="_blank"}.  

Breathwork really works for me, a couple rounds of deep breathing and I'm high on my own supply. And that gives me overconfidence to jump head on in this area (sometimes _pushing the boundaries_ quite a lot).  

On the first day of the workshop I stayed for 5:00 minutes in the icy water while everybody else stayed 2 minutes only, the recommendation for first timers (told you I'm _special_), no hands under water (covid rules).  

Second day - 5:30 minutes, hands under. This really made a big difference, this was way harder than the previous day and I've probably pushed too much, but hey: no pain, no gain! I got out when I couldn't control / stop shivering.  

Under extreme cold, the extremities are the first ones to be "disconnected" (you can live with no legs or hands, but not without most of the organs) so my hands really took the hit on the second run.  

3 weeks after the workshop, I still have some numbness in my right index, but I'm not too worried about it, I still have 9 healthy fingers left :D
